# RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)
    - RNN is a type of Sequential Model
    - Works best with sequential data, eg: sentences, time series data, speech, dna
    - RNNs are used the most in NLP
    - RNNs have a memory feature, which makes them suitable for sequential data

## Why ANNs or CNNs fail on sequential data
    - Textual data (input) can be of varying sizes
    - Zero padding leads to unnecessary calculations
    - When words are converted to vectors
        + it increases computational cost
        + increases complexity (more number of weights and baises)
    - Even if we go ahead, the test data could be of different size (exceeding the input paddings)
    - Totally disregarding the sequential information, but the sequence contains some meaning

## Use Cases
    - Sentiment analysis
    - Sentence completion
    - Image caption generator
    - Language detection
    - Machine translation
    - Question Answer agent
    - Time series forecasting
    - Speech classification
