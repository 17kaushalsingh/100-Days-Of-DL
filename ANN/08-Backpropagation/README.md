# Backpropagation

## Algorithm
- 0. Initialize weights and biases
- 1. Select a random datapoint (row)
- 2. FORWARD PROPAGATION: Predict the output using the initial weights and biases
- 3. CALCULATE LOSS: Choose a loss function and calculate loss
- 4. BACKPROPAGATION Of ERRORS: Update Weights and Biases
