# Pooling Layers

    Problems with Convolution Operation
    - Memory in CPU
    - Translattional Variance - feature kaha h usse farak padta h
    - Pooling is basically, selecting one value from a smaller matrix to represent the entire matrix

## Advantages of Pooling

    - Reduces size of feature map
    - Enhanced feature map, only in case of MaxPooling
    - 

## Types of Pooling
    - Max Pooling
    - Min Pooling
    - Global Pooling (can be used just before sending to fully connected layers)
        + Global Max Pooling
        + Global Average Pooling
    - Average Pooling
    - L2 Pooling
